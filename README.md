**International federation for the development and syndication of public works.**

## About Us

Elastic-Softworks is a software federation bringing together developers, archivists, writers, and artists who are passionate about creating and maintaining public works. We believe in collaborative development and the open sharing of knowledge, tools, and creative works that benefit communities worldwide.

## Our Mission

We focus on:
- Developing software and tools for public benefit
- Archiving and preserving digital works and knowledge
- Supporting creative and technical collaboration
- Syndicating public works to reach broader audiences

## Geographic Presence

While our foundation is rooted in the greater Arkansas, Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama region, we proudly operate as an international federation. Our members and projects span across different countries and time zones, united by our shared commitment to public works.
