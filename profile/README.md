# ELASTIC SOFTWORKS

Elastic Softworks is a federation of developers, writers, archivists, and artists dedicated to the creation and maintaining of public works.

While our foundation is rooted in the greater Arkansas, Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama region, Elastic Softworks operates as an international federation.

## MISSION

Our goals are the following:

- The on-going development of free software, tools, and codebases for public benefit.
- Archiving and preserving digital works and knowledge.
- The syndication and proliferation of public works.
